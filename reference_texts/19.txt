Harrington offers this advice to any senior who thinks it’s too late to start exercising, or who fears working out will be too hard during their remaining years: “How do you want to spend that time? Do you want to be able to get up off the couch, or do you want to get up and fall down? It’s the quality of life. If you want a sedentary life, you’ll die sitting on the friggin’ couch. I’d rather die in the mountains or out in the desert.”
