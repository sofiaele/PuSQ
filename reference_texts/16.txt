I remember thinking it would be nice to get the 5km time back towards the 30-minute mark, but the descent into the mid-twenties has caught me off guard. These numbers are only a benchmark though. They are a rough indicator of progress and show that the system is working. Something that has become far more important to me is the enjoyment of running as part of my identity. Thatâ€™s the most liberating thing I have learned and the positive results are a bonus. When we focus on the right things and look at them in the right way, the human mind and body are capable of truly remarkable progress.
