What I’ve learned from reading a lot is that you don’t need to read fifty books each year like Bill Gates to truly make a difference in your life. If only pick a few good books, read them over and over again, and religiously apply them to your life, you’ll experience a remarkable transformation. It’s no use reading just for the sake of it. As Bob Proctor said: “No amount of reading or memorizing will make you successful in life. It is the understanding and application of wise thought that counts.”
