“In the case of good books, the point is not to see how many of them you can get through, but rather how many can get through to you,” writes Mortimer J. Adler. If you read only one good book this year, this is the one that will change how you see the world. If you read only two good books this year, let the content of this book hit home once again. It’s that powerful.
