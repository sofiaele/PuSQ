Most people who decide to take up lifting eventually discover one of two programs, Starting Strength or Strong Lifts 5×5. Both programs have the same general philosophy, which is that heavy weight for five reps is the way to build strength. Trainers in most gyms seem to promote lower weight for higher reps, perhaps out of liability concerns. Barbell training does require good form and some dedicated planning, but it also brings clarity to your gym routine. Low weight with high reps promotes hypertrophy — big muscles. High weight with low reps promotes dense muscles — a.k.a. strength. That was appealing now that I was regularly carrying around a toddler and all her gear.
