I’m a fan of slow-reading when it comes to learning. I don’t read slowly when I’m reading for pleasure. But when it comes to reading to learn, I personally prefer being a turtle rather than a hare. And by reading slowly, I mean nothing more than allowing some breathing space to actually contemplate the lessons. And perhaps rereading the difficult ones. Or making notes to dissect and understand them better. And in the end, practising them in real life, to start the excruciatingly slow process of rewiring your subconscious.
