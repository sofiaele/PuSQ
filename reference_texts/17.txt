Some days it’s been easy, others it’s felt nearly impossible to get in my daily mileage. The streak has been particularly difficult to keep after running marathons, and most recently, my 100 mile ultramarathon where I could barely walk for days. I’ve ran with a pneumonia, the flu, countless colds and other illnesses. I even ran with a hip flexor strain so bad that I couldn’t even walk a few feet without holding onto a wall. Some may say I’m batshit crazy, but I’d say I’m determined…with a little hint of crazy.
