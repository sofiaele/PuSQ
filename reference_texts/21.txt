It’s not a secret by now that James Patterson doesn’t write his own material. Building from the popularity of his early success as a writer, Patterson has managed to become a self-made publishing mogul. Now, instead of putting in the work of writing himself, he simply lends the established credibility of his author’s name recognition to others, saying he gives them outlines, but honestly, I doubt he even does that any more. His name is nothing but a marketing gimmick turned “literary” monopoly.
