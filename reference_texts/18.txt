My daily runs are a time solely dedicated to me. A time that allows the attentional space I need for new, fresh ideas to develop. A time to work out solutions to difficult problems at work and in my relationships. I never had a precocious talent for running and am far from an elite athlete. Running taught me that with consistent work, even the most outlandish goals are possible to achieve.
