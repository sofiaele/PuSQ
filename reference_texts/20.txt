The bad news is that, like exercise, taking control of what you eat isn’t optional if you’re serious about not only losing weight and getting in shape, but maintaining your progress. (Eating whatever whenever is how you got to where you are, so change is a must.) The good news is that you don’t need to cut out all of your favorite foods or eat flavorless diet food that you hate. You do need to start regulating calorie intake and setting some limits for yourself by changing how you eat.
