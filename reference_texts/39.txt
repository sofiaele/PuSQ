The rest of the politico sphere, particularly on television, is a parade of scum. The hideous gauntlet of politics weeds out rational people from running for public office, and now political commenting does the same thing. It’s a shiver of sharks all feeding each other their own tails. The perception of reality should never take precedence over reality itself, but national political coverage does precisely that. All the time. I can’t live in that world anymore.
