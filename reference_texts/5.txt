Crucial to the success of diarization is the distance metric between speech segments, a factor depending on the choice of the feature space: distances should be low for segments of the same speaker and high for segments of different speakers. Starting from an Mel-frequency cepstrum coefficient (MFCC)-based feature space, an algorithm is proposed that finds a Fisher near-optimal linear discriminant subspace, adapted to the particular speakers which exist in the audio signal. The proposed approach relies on a semi-supervised version of Fisher linear discriminant analysis (FLD), leveraging information from the sequential structure of the audio signal as a substitute for unknown speaker labels.
