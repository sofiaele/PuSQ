Deep learning systems, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), can infer a hierarchical representation of input data that facilitates categorization. In this paper, we propose to learn affect-salient features for Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) using semi-CNN. The training of semi-CNN has two stages. In the first stage, unlabeled samples are used to learn candidate features by contractive convolutional neural network with reconstruction penalization.
