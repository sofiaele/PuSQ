Why is Dimension Reduction important in machine learning predictive modeling? The problem of unwanted increase in dimension is closely related to others. That was to fixation of measuring/recording data at a far granular level then it was done in past. This is no way suggesting that this is a recent problem. It has started gaining more importance lately due to a surge in data. Lately, there has been a tremendous increase in the way sensors are being used in the industry. These sensors continuously record data and store it for analysis at a later point. In the way data gets captured, there can be a lot of redundancy.
