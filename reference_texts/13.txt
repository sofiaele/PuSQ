Productivity is something that everyone struggles with from time to time. No matter how motivated or self-disciplined you are, it gets the best of all of us. Sometimes when I push my workout until later in the day, I find myself less productive. I lay in bed scrolling on my phone for an hour or two and take my good old time when I could have spent it more wisely doing something else. However, if you force yourself to workout at a time like 5am, you donâ€™t have much time to waste. You wake up early, grab your gym bag and get going.
