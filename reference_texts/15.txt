Maintaining a breathing rhythm is essential. Otherwise, the disruption to your airflow becomes very distracting, and you start to feel as if you are not getting enough fresh air. Once this feeling takes hold, it becomes self-fulfilling as you start to panic mildly, and feel faint By focusing on a breathing rhythm, you can get your brain in tune with your energy needs and your legs (and arms). You can control your ability to slow a little and to bring everything back to serving your pace. I found that you can develop this control within 10 running-days. Then after 3 weeks, it becomes a well-developed skill.
