When encountering a pixel of a certain color in an image, it can most often be assumed to belong to a single object. Discrete sound events do not separate into layers on a spectrogram: Instead, they all sum together into a distinct whole. That means that a particular observed frequency in a spectrogram cannot be assumed to belong to a single sound as the magnitude of that frequency could have been produced by any number of accumulated sounds or even by the complex interactions between sound waves such as phase cancellation. This makes it difficult to separate simultaneous sounds in spectrogram representations.
