Fast Fourier Transform is a widely used algorithm in Computer Science. It is also generally regarded as difficult to understand. I have spent the last few days trying to understand the algorithm â€” how it works and why. In the process I digressed to various other mathematical topics to build a complete understanding ground up. Here, I have tried to collate and document everything I have learnt. In this blog, we will use FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) to solve the problem of quickly multiplying two polynomials. I must warn that this is a long (and tedious?) post. But, you should be able to read and understand everything from start to end without having to look anything up.
