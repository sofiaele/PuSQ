This time around, this isn’t a fight between the two major political parties. You’re not voting on a Democratic or Republican leader. You’re voting on whether or not you want the president of the United States to have basic human decency. We can agree to disagree. That’s the beautiful thing about our world. We have the right to have our own political beliefs, our own priorities, our own personal opinions. Part of a free country is being free to express your uniqueness. We can disagree politically. We can be friends and have different political beliefs. I truly wholeheartedly believe that. But we can’t disagree with what human decency means.
