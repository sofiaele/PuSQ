When I first began a very structured weight lifting routine my freshman year of college, my coach placed a lot of emphasis on a few key exercises, one of which was the squat. I was weak and inexperienced, and I struggled to lift more than the 45 pound bar with proper form. Iâ€™ll admit that I was a little embarrassed, but I accepted where I was at. After all, everyone has to start somewhere. Every single day that I stepped foot in the weight room, I worked hard to get stronger. By the end of the year, I was able to squat double the weight that I started with, and my race times improved immensely.
